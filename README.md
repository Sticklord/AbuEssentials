# AbuEssentials

Core addon required for all, except oUF_Abu. Does alot of stuff.
Look in the CONFIG.lua for options.

Tips:
- Hold ALT and CTRL when visiting a vendor to sell all green/blue gear below 500 itemlevel that's not soulbound when visiting vendor. (Salvage stuff)
- Hold SHIFT to show itemlevel in tooltips.
- Scroll the add workorder button to add workorders.
- Type '/alertframe' to move the alert frame for loot won etc.
- Type '/abusetup' to setup the chat and some CVars to my preffered layout.
